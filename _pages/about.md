I'm a PhD candidate at the University of Michigan studying machine learning and signal processing. With an interest in understanding and communicating with the brain, my [research](/research) in the [Chestek lab](https://chestekresearch.engin.umich.edu/) focuses on algorithms for brain-computer interfaces.

Outside of research, I like to do circuits/ML/woodworking [projects](/projects), take outdoor [photos](/photography), and swim/bike/run at the national level with the UofM Triathlon [Club](https://www.instagram.com/umichtriathlon/).
